Randomizer
==========
Unofficial application that uses random.org services, Randomizer lets you create one real random number from a range of two integers.

------------
Generating random numbers from a machine is not real randomness. Instead, in this small project we are leveraging a small interface with random.org servers, which provides real randomness.
